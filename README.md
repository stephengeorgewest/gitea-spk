# gitea-spk

Fork from [gogs-spk](https://github.com/alexandregz/gogs-spk) to create a SPK package for [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea), a [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) fork.

### Dependencies

The Gitea package requires the **[Git Server](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/packages/Git)** package.

### Package creation

To create the package, clone the repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/flipswitchingmonkey/gitea-spk.git`

Change into the newly created directory - the root directory:

`$ cd gitea-spk`

Download the Gitea binary matching your architecture from https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/releases into the root directory. For example, a DiskStation with an ARMv7 CPU would require:

`$ wget https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/releases/download/v1.1.4/gitea-1.1.4-linux-arm-7`

Invoke the build script to have the package created:

`$ ./create_spk.sh`

The install package matching your binary (here `gitea-1.1.4-linux-arm-7.spk`) will be created in the root directory.

If you have several binaries downloaded, you can specify the binary for which the package should be created:

`$ ./create_spk.sh gitea-1.1.3-linux-arm-7`

### Installation

Make sure **Package Center > Settings > General > Trust Level** is set to **Any Publisher** and perform installation via **Package Center > Manual Install**.

![Select Package](screenshots/install_select_package.png)

The installer will create the (internal) user/group gitea:gitea when not found and the executable is run with this user.

When installation has finished, the package center shows url and status of your Gitea server.

When accessed for the first time, Gitea will greet you with the installation settings. You should set your **Repository Root Path** to a shared folder. You can configure permissions for shared folders in the control panel via **Edit > Permissions > System internal user** to grant the Gitea user permission.

Tested to work on DS116 with Gitea 1.0.1.
